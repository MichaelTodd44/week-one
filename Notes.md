First and foremost, even as someone who is currently undertaking a minor in Medieval History, the term itself 'Digatal history' is rather foreign to me. There, I did a little bit of research into what Digital history is as a core value to get some background. This was evfen more reinforced when I read the thread by Amalia Skarlatou via Twitter.
Set up my git-hub, and created the numerous respositories as was requested
I already had Hypothesis downloaded due to the fact I took the MEMS course with Marc Saruette which is 'Discovering the Medieval and Early Modern Past'
Downloaded Zotero, and actually used Zotero as a consistent tool I'm going to use for my many other classes. 
Looked over the Value of Proceedings as a Historical Source as it was the first item that Amalia had put within her Twitter thread, so I may understand what she was relaying. This caught my attention due to the fact my Major at Carleton University is Criminoly itself, with a focus in Psychology. However, being Criminology allows me to branch into three different aspects of Psychology, Sociology and Law. Reason I read the Proceeding was due to its direct relation to Law, and the records of law. 
Read The Project Overview as its name enticed me, read the Deconlizing the Archive, Research Guides, and lastly I read the Disclaimer and Usage Statement. As I stated before, it caught my eye due to the fact it had the National Police of Guatamala, and her wordings made me dig into what she stated.
