First and foremost, I will start this off with a little reflection; as I stated within the notes I am not a Digital History expert at all, or am taking IT, or Computer Science in any way shape or form. I have little knowledge in what actually it takes to categorized things such as Metadata, and such as my roomate tends to tell me about. I am simply a Criminology Student, with a minor in History who enjoys past history, especially thoughts in regards to Greek, Roman, Medieval to Victorian Era History. I have always shyed away from recent history for anything past World War Two. However, I decided to change my mind up in the first place and try something that is directly modern and can expand my horizons into the Digital Age. 

As I stated earlier, I have very little knowledge in actual coding and such, but I am a rather functional person upon the Computer, as I used to and perhaps still do spend too much time on my computer a day playing games that my parents say rot my brain away. The only real issue I had whilst setting up this course was practicing and getting used to Zotero. I'm going to add two files, I created which opened up a word and a google chrome file. I'll link them in the GitHub respository. I eventually figured out, and instead of creating multiple files, I set it to copy to clipboard which helped my problems.
